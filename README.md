idea for program for which currently don't have time to work (not sure if good idea just idea):
calculates computers current speed

tooling stories:
gather working CPU power of computer
allow user to specify: example data (hence data type, data size?) to populate rows (or range of file)
user determined: how many rows of example data.

point of program is to do mockups and i.e. "how fast would user's current machine using current function iterate through billion.length array
